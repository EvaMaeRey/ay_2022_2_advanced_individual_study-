# Extending ggplot2 statistical geometries
Here, laying out some objectives for independent study, MA489!

### Build grammar of graphics knowledge and ggplot2 programming know-how

- learning more about ggplot2 architechture and extension capabilities
   - grammar of graphic and waves of data visualization https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itChfcTx7ao
   - ggplot2 book: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/ 
   - Thomas Lin Peterson Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj7A3i2fi54
   - Hadley Wickham Vingette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/extending-ggplot2.html
   - A set of examples made for you:  https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggextend  (note to self: https://twitter.com/EvaMaeRey/status/1353526310283464705)
- writing useful functions for statistical education (and for practicianers!)
  - linear model diagnostics  
    - high leverage points
    - high influence points
    - cooks distance
  - other ideas:  http://www.rossmanchance.com/ISIapplets.html
- learning about package development and architecture

### Providing a *usable* set functions in a package (ggxmean)
- https://evamaerey.github.io/ggxmean/, https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggxmean
- improving and standardizing documentation, examples
- submitting package to CRAN
- soliciting feedback from potential users, experts.  Usability survey... 

### Outreach and brand
- hex sticker? https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker
- tutorials??
- presentations - https://evamaerey.github.io/ggxmean/talk_maa_metro_ny.html#1, USMA presentation opportunties ??
- paper - https://evamaerey.github.io/ggxmean/manuscript.pdf, journal target: https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ujse20/current
